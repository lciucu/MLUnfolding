\section{The method}
\label{sec:Method}

My first step was to study a code example using some toy data in a JupyterNotebook~\cite{glazov}. At the beginning I ran the code on a cloud (Swan). 

\ \\The next step was to run it on \texttt{lxplus}. For this it was needed to run after \texttt{ssh}-ing to a \texttt{lxplus} machine a singularity command~\cite{Singularity} and then to my own laptop.

\ \\To train the neural network it was needed to use the Python library Keras~\cite{keras} and for backend TensorFlow~\cite{tensorflow}. My method of sampling was implemented using numpy~\cite{numpy}.
